# adaptive

Adaptive GTK4 mobile components for [gotk4][gotk4] to replace
[libadwaita][libadwaita].

## Why?

[libadwaita][libadwaita] currently enforces the Adwaita theme on all
applications that use it. This gives the user no choice on any of its
themes and customizations.

This library doesn't enforce any themes. It provides only the widget components.
